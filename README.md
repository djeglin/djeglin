# Hey!

I'm djeglin, and I make cool sh\*t with code. I work at [AND Digital](https://and.digital), where I help our clients create awesome digital products, and my fellow developers reach their career goals. In the past I have worked for a number of big agencies such as McCann, AKQA, Razorfish and others to create projects for the likes of JCB, Jaguar Land Rover, Bentley Motors, Bugatti, McDonalds, Nike, Sky TV, The National Lottery and Argos. I have contributed to a few open source projects over the years, but often struggle to set aside enough time to devote to properly giving back to the community.

## Tech

Tech-wise, I'm a big JAMstack advocate, so here's my jam:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

To get into some specifics, here are the libraries, frameworks and tools that I use on a regular basis:

- [Sanity](https://sanity.io)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev)
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) & [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) & [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (although I'm using this less and less as time goes on)

I've at least tried a bunch of other frameworks, tools and content solutions, but those are the most regularly used ones in recent years. 

## Elsewhere

You can find me on Twitter ([@djeglin](https://www.twitter.com/djeglin)) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/djeglin/) and there's always my old website, which I never get around to updating, at [https://djegl.in](https://djegl.in)
